Secure Communication and Password Manager with SSL and RSA
Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of two major security components:

SSL-Based Secure Communication Channel: This part of the project is dedicated to establishing a secure communication channel using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates. The focus is on implementing robust encryption methods to safeguard data during transmission, ensuring that all communications over the channel are protected from unauthorized access and interception.

RSA-Enhanced Password Manager: The second component is a basic password manager, fortified with the RSA encryption algorithm. This manager not only securely stores passwords but also ensures their confidentiality and integrity using RSA's powerful encryption techniques. The emphasis is on achieving a balance between high-level security and user accessibility.

Project Goals
Develop a deep understanding of SSL and RSA encryption methods: Gain practical experience in implementing these advanced security protocols.
Implement a secure communication channel: Utilize SSL certificates to encrypt data during transmission, providing a safe and reliable communication medium.
Create a secure password manager: Leverage the RSA algorithm to enhance the security of stored passwords, making the manager resistant to common cyber threats.
